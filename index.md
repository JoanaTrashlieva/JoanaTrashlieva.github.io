## Hi! 👋

I am a software developer in the fin-tech industry.
Previosuly, I worked as a web developer using Magento 2 and WordPress.

> "Where there is a will, there is a way!"

Following this as a guiding principle, after high-school I moved to the UK to 
study Computer Science in university. I will soon be relocating to the Netherlands
to pursue a masters degree. 

In my free time I like playing basketball 🏀  and building robots!  🤖
