# Personal website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll themes
Previously, I have written my website in CMSs such as Wordpress or even in Magento 2 for a short time. 
But the maintanance of custom hosting, SSL, emails, etc. is too much for just a hobby. 
So I decided to give GitHub Pages a go. 

# Current state
As of 18/12/2020:

* still working on initial setup of the repo - locally and on the server
* decided on a them to use - <code>jekyll-theme-minimal</code>
* write actual content
