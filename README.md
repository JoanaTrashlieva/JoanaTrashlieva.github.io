## Who am I

I am a recent graduate from Aberystwyth University, Wales. Currently working in the fin-tech industry as a software developer 👩‍💻. I have a couple of years experience in web development with CMS platforms - Magento 2, WordPress, as well as customer developed websites (see [projects]).

In my free time I like playing basketball, figeting with an Arduino (meet [cool name goes here :D]) and generaly being outdoors when we are not under lockdown.

I'd like to think that this best describes me:

> Where there is will,
> there is a way!
